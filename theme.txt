✅ Page Background Color Theme (Max 4 Colors)
Purpose	Color Name	Usage
Base Background	Off-White (light gray or soft white)	Use for most page backgrounds (e.g., #F8FAFC, #FAFAFA) — keeps things clean and breathable
Highlight Section	Light Blue (very soft sky)	Use for callout blocks, "Why Us", testimonials, or “Explore Courses”
Dark Section	Charcoal / Navy Blue	Use for hero sections, footer, or contrast blocks — gives authority and focus
Accent Background	Soft Yellow / Beige	Use sparingly for CTA banners, demo callouts, or pricing highlights — draws attention gently

🧠 How to Apply (Example Use Per Page)
🏠 Home Page:
Hero → Navy Blue

"Why Choose Us" → Light Blue

CTA → Soft Yellow

Rest → Off-White

📘 Courses Page:
Background → Off-White

Course Cards section → Light Blue

📞 Contact/Register Pages:
Main background → Off-White

Form block → White or Light Blue card

🎯 Bonus Tips
Avoid too many bold colors in the background — keep those for buttons and icons.

Use dark sections only where you want deep focus or contrast.

If you're ever unsure, fall back to Off-White + Navy + Light Blue — it's a safe trio.
